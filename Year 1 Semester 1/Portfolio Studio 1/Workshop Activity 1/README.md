# COSC2803 Workshop 01 Starter Code
This repository contains the starter code for:
* Java practice exercises
* HTML practice exercises

## Java Practice Exercises
Contained in the folder 'java'.
It is divided into two sub-folders

* `prereq` - for students who have successfully passed COSC2801 (Programming Bootcamp 1) as a pre-requisite to the Programming Studio 1.
* `coreq` - for students who are taking COSC2801 (Programming Bootcamp 1) as a co-requisite to the Programming Studio 1.

This is for practicing how to:

* Revise Java programming from Bootcamp (for pre-req students)
* Practicing Java skills currently being learnt in Bootcamp (for co-req students)

## HTML Practice Exercises
Contained in the folder 'html'.
This is a simple template for a basic HTML site. This is a cutdown version of the HTML for Julie's page Version 1. You are able to use this HTML as a starting point for creating your own page in the Project Workshop for Week 01.

The exercises in this folder are for all students.

# DEV Container for GitHub Codespaces
The ```.devcontainer``` folder contains configuration files for GitHub Codespaces.
This ensures that when the GitHub classroom is cloned, the workspace is correctly configured for Java (V17) and with the required VSCode extensions.
This folder will not affect a *local* VSCode setup on a computer.
