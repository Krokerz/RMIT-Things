  <h1>Kevin Octavius</h1>

  <h2>Brief Bio</h2>
  <p>I am a computer science student at RMIT University.
    I really enjoy maths, problem solving, and coding as so as being really interested in AI and automation ever since I was in middle school.
    My hobbies include gaming and swimming, although I admit it has been a while since I've swam in a pool.
    I'm not the social type, but I'm constantly working to improve upon that (hopefully).</p>
